Deployment 1
---

1. Was able to Login to Jenkins server and setup the pipeline
2. Ran the build and got an error in the test stage
3. Looked at the logs from the build and it stated the following "you need to install the python3-venv
package"
4. Went into the Jenkinsfile and added the command to install the needed python package
